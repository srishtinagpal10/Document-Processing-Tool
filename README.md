# Document-Processing-Tool

Created a search engine in C++ that returns all matching answers to an input query in the corpus of documents provided to the program. Also maintained a dictionary that counts the number of occurrences of each word in the given corpus. Developed an algorithm to rank the search results and select top sentences or paragraphs for a given query and feed those to ChatGPT API along with the query and get the required results which are displayed to the user. Focused both on the correctness and efficiency of the dictionary and pattern search algorithm
